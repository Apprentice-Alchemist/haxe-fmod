This is a utility script that will make using your FMOD Studio events in code much easier

To setup, do the following:
- Next to your FMOD Studio project file, create a text file titled "HaxeConstantsOutputLocation" and put the destination of where you want the constants file to be saved. An example of what it will look like can be found next to this readme file.
- Place the ExportHaxeConstants.js file in your FMOD Studio's "scripts" folder. This folder will be found wherever you installed FMOD Studio on your computer.
- In FMOD Studio, click the Scripts dropdown at the top and select "Reload". Click on the Scripts dropdown again and you will see an "Export Haxe Constants" option now available.
